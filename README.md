# Music Player Project (Arduino)

- Plays melodies on a buzzer based on button presses.
- Includes three pre-loaded songs: Merry Christmas, Nokia Song, Happy Birthday.
- Utilizes an LCD screen to display the song name during playback.

Based on the wiring, in this project is geared towards user interaction:
- Button presses (detected as "Down" or "D" state) might trigger sounds on the speaker.
- Buttons could also be used to control information displayed on the LCD or change LED colors.
